# Mod API reference

The contract between Horizon and its mods: the WIT package `horizon:mods@0.1.0`, every interface, type, function and hook in it, and the capabilities a manifest may list. The guide is [mods.md](../mods.md); stability and versions: [stability.md](stability.md). Manifest `api` lines this game serves: `0.1`, `0.2`.

## Capabilities

| In `capabilities` | Grants | The player reads "May …" |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `game-read` | [`game`](#game) | see your position, health and the time |
| `chat` | [`chat`](#chat) | show you chat messages |
| `hud` | [`hud`](#hud) | draw text on your screen |
| `storage` | [`storage`](#storage) | save its own settings to disk |
| `registries` | data files (`assets/`, `data/`), no interface | add blocks and items to your worlds |

| Function | Signature | What it does |
