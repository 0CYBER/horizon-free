## AMD FidelityFX SDK (FSR 3.1 frame generation)

`crates/horizon-client-render/src/gfx/frame_gen/optical_flow.wgsl` is a port to WGSL of the
optical flow shaders of the [AMD FidelityFX SDK](https://github.com/GPUOpen-LibrariesAndSDKs/FidelityFX-SDK)
1.1.4 (`sdk/include/FidelityFX/gpu/opticalflow`, at commit
[c6efa6bf7f20](https://github.com/GPUOpen-LibrariesAndSDKs/FidelityFX-SDK/tree/c6efa6bf7f2027b3ec94f28578bb5965eabb9e55)),
and `optical_flow.rs` follows the SDK's `sdk/src/components/opticalflow/ffx_opticalflow.cpp`
(its passes, their order and their dispatch sizes). Copyright (C) 2024 Advanced Micro Devices,
